## Raw Socket Application
A `wget` FTP application to download files for input URLs and implemented TCP/IP headers and packet validation. Implemented using a three-way handshake and a congestion control mechanism with the server to prevent packet loss by 10%.

# Research Papers
## Performance Analysis of TCP Variants
The TCP protocol was designed to provide end-to-end reliability in data transfer. This protocol adds a layer of congestion control, a necessary part of the Internet.

The paper presents a study on the different variants of TCP that are used widely across multiple operating systems (Tahoe, Reno, NewReno, and Vegas) and analyze their performance using different parameters (throughput, drop rate, and latency) under varying degrees of congestion, using NS-2 simulation. The analysis will help us understand the behavior of these variants in terms of congestion avoidance and fairness among them. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of different queueing disciplines between TCP variants.
